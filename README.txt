Installation:

Install extension and add static template.

at the bottom of content elements, another image upload field appears, as well as a checkbox to 
enable/disable overlay images. Do not forget to enable the checkbox...

Overlay images will be resized to the size of the original content images. Therefore it is 
advised to resize the overlay images to the same aspect ratio as the original images, 
otherwise they will be distorted.

Overlay images will be used in the order they appear in the list. If you add less overlay images
than content images, the last overlay image will be repeated until all content images are overlayed.
You can use this to overlay all images with the same image by uploading just one overlay image.
